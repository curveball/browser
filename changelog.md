  the response headers.


0.7.1 (2019-03-25)
------------------

  intent of that header is to allow people to create downloads for users,

  Curl and Fetch.

------------------

* It's now possible to get alternative representations in a browser with the
  `?_browser-accept` query parameter.
* Links with the `alternate` rel that are local, automatically get the
  `?_browser-accept` parameter added, so a single resource can now have
  multiple representations on the same url.
* Now using a new package for parsing HTTP Link urls. The old one didn't
  support multiple links with the same `rel`.


0.5.6 (2018-10-04)
------------------

  although time will tell if this is correct.

  single templated query parameter.
